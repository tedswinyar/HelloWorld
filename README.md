#HelloWorld
==========

First GitHub test project

Mic check, mic check, 1, 2, 1, 2

"Hello, World"

MD is pretty simple, really. Just a matter of getting used to the basics of what we can do
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

Or a list

1. this is item 1
2. Item 3
3. Item 3

That didn't work, maybe my syntax is off?

1 item 1
2 item 2
3 item 3

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
ии* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
ии1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.
