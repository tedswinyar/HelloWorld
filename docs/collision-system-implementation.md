# Enemy-Player Collision System Implementation

## Overview

Task 5.2 "Implement enemy-player collision system" has been successfully completed. This implementation adds collision detection between enemies and players, implements a life system with game over logic, and handles player respawn and life management.

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 3.2: Enemy-Player Collision
- ✅ **WHEN an enemy touches the player character THEN the player SHALL lose a life**
- Implemented collision detection using distance-based calculations
- Collision detection runs every frame during game updates
- Only processes collisions when player is not in invulnerability period

### Requirement 3.3: Life System and Game Over
- ✅ **WHEN the player loses all lives THEN the game SHALL end**
- Player starts with 3 lives
- Lives decrease when hit by non-vulnerable enemies
- Game over triggers when lives reach 0
- AI system deactivates on game over
- Game over screen displays with auto-restart functionality

### Requirement 7.4: Life Management and Respawn
- ✅ **Player respawn and life management system**
- Player respawns after losing a life (if lives > 0)
- 2-second invulnerability period after respawn
- Visual flashing effect during invulnerability
- Player repositioned to starting location on respawn
- 1-second delay before respawn to show impact

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Collision Detection System
```javascript
handleEnemyCollisions() {
    // Skip during invulnerability
    if (this.invulnerabilityTime > 0) return;
    
    const collidingEnemies = this.aiController.checkPlayerCollisions(playerPos, playerSize);
    
    for (const enemy of collidingEnemies) {
        if (enemy.getIsVulnerable()) {
            this.handleVulnerableEnemyCollision(enemy); // Player eats enemy
        } else {
            this.handleEnemyHitPlayer(enemy); // Player loses life
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Life Management System
- **Initial Lives**: 3 lives per game
- **Life Loss**: Triggered by collision with non-vulnerable enemies
- **Invulnerability**: 2-second period after respawn prevents immediate re-collision
- **Visual Feedback**: Flashing player sprite during invulnerability

### 3. Respawn System
```javascript
respawnPlayer() {
    this.isRespawning = true;
    this.player.stop();
    this.invulnerabilityTime = this.invulnerabilityDuration;
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.resetPlayerPosition();
        this.isRespawning = false;
    }, this.respawnDelay);
}
```

### 4. Game Over Logic
- **Trigger**: When lives reach 0
- **Actions**: 
  - Stop game engine
  - Deactivate AI controller
  - Display game over screen
  - Auto-restart after 5 seconds

### 5. Power Pellet Integration
- **Vulnerable Enemies**: Can be eaten for points instead of causing damage
- **Point Values**: Different enemy types award different points (100-400)
- **Enemy Removal**: Vulnerable enemies are removed when eaten

## Integration with Existing Systems

### GameEngine Integration
- Added AIController and Player class integration
- Modified update loop to include enemy collision checking
- Updated render method to show invulnerability effects
- Integrated with existing pellet collection system

### Player Class Integration
- Uses existing Player class for position and movement
- Leverages Player's collision detection methods
- Maintains compatibility with existing input handling

### AI Controller Integration
- Uses AIController's collision detection methods
- Integrates with enemy vulnerability system
- Supports enemy removal when eaten

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (9 tests)
- ✅ Collision detection accuracy
- ✅ Life loss on enemy hit
- ✅ Game over trigger
- ✅ Points awarded for eating vulnerable enemies
- ✅ Respawn system functionality
- ✅ Invulnerability period behavior
- ✅ Power pellet effects
- ✅ Enemy point values

### Integration Tests (4 tests)
- ✅ Complete collision workflow
- ✅ Power pellet vulnerability workflow
- ✅ Game over scenario
- ✅ Invulnerability collision ignoring

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Collision Detection**: Uses distance-based calculations
- **Frame-Rate Friendly**: Collision detection runs once per frame
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of removed enemies
- **State Management**: Minimal state tracking for invulnerability

## Visual Feedback

### Player Invulnerability
- Flashing sprite effect (200ms intervals)
- Cyan glow indicator around player
- Visual feedback duration matches invulnerability period

### Game Over Screen
- Semi-transparent overlay
- Final score display
- Auto-restart countdown message

## Configuration Options

```javascript
// Collision system configuration
this.invulnerabilityDuration = 2000; // 2 seconds
this.respawnDelay = 1000; // 1 second
this.gameState.lives = 3; // Starting lives

// Enemy point values
const pointValues = {
    'chaser': 200,
    'ambusher': 400,
    'patrol': 300,
    'random': 100,
    'ghost': 200
};
```

## Future Enhancements

The collision system is designed to be extensible for future features:
- Different enemy damage amounts
- Power-ups that affect collision behavior
- Temporary shields or protection items
- Multiplayer collision handling
- Sound effects for collisions

## Conclusion

The enemy-player collision system successfully implements all required functionality:
- ✅ Collision detection between enemies and player
- ✅ Life system with proper game over logic
- ✅ Player respawn and life management
- ✅ Integration with power pellet vulnerability system
- ✅ Comprehensive testing coverage
- ✅ Visual feedback and user experience enhancements

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and integrates seamlessly with the Player, AIController, and GameEngine systems.
